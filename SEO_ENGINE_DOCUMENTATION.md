# Modern SEO Engine Documentation (2024+)

## Overview

The Max Your Points CMS features a cutting-edge, real-time SEO analysis engine that aligns with 2024+ search engine best practices. Built around modern SEO concepts like E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust), search intent matching, and semantic analysis, this engine goes far beyond traditional keyword-focused approaches.

## Core Architecture

### Modern SEO Philosophy

The engine prioritizes:
- **Search Intent Matching** over keyword density
- **Topic Authority** over individual keyword optimization  
- **E-E-A-T Signals** for content quality assessment
- **User Experience** and readability metrics
- **Featured Snippet Optimization** for SERP features
- **Semantic Relationships** using knowledge graphs

### Advanced Scoring System

The modern scoring system uses a 100-point weighted algorithm:

```typescript
const MODERN_SEO_WEIGHTS = {
  SEARCH_INTENT_MATCH: 25,      // Most important: Does content match user intent?
  CONTENT_QUALITY: 20,           // Including E-E-A-T signals
  TECHNICAL_SEO: 15,             // Including Core Web Vitals
  USER_EXPERIENCE: 15,           // Readability, structure, engagement
  KEYWORD_OPTIMIZATION: 10,      // Less important now (semantic search)
  LINK_PROFILE: 10,              // Internal/external linking strategy
  FRESHNESS: 5                   // Content recency and updates
}
```

## Search Intent & Topic Modeling

### Search Intent Classification

The engine automatically classifies content based on search intent:

- **Informational**: Educational content (how-to, guides, explanations)
- **Commercial**: Research-focused content (reviews, comparisons)
- **Transactional**: Purchase-focused content (deals, booking)
- **Navigational**: Brand/site-specific content

### Semantic Analysis

Uses a knowledge graph approach to analyze topic coverage:

```typescript
const TOPIC_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH = {
  'travel': ['vacation', 'trip', 'destination', 'tourism'],
  'credit cards': ['rewards', 'points', 'miles', 'cashback'],
  'hotels': ['accommodation', 'booking', 'luxury', 'amenities']
}
```

- **Topic Completeness**: Measures how comprehensively the content covers related concepts
- **Semantic Relevance**: Analyzes related term usage vs simple keyword density
- **Missing Terms**: Identifies semantic gaps in content coverage
