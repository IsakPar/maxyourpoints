- **Status**: Database connections and API keys need production setup
- **Impact**: Even if deployed, services won't connect properly

### **3. Database Connection**
- **Problem**: Production database not configured on Railway
- **Status**: Need to set up PostgreSQL database and migrate schema
- **Impact**: No data persistence or API functionality

## 📋 Immediate Action Plan (Next 48 Hours)

### **Phase 1: Fix Deployment (Priority 1)**

#### Step 1: Railway Configuration Fix
```bash
# Current issues to resolve:
1. Remove conflicting railway.json files
2. Fix nixpacks.toml to properly identify backend
3. Set Railway to deploy backend only
4. Configure proper start commands
```

#### Step 2: Environment Setup
```bash
# Required environment variables for Railway:
- DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection)
- JWT_SECRET (authentication)
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY  
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
- PORT (auto-set by Railway)
```

#### Step 3: Database Setup
```bash
# Tasks:
1. Create PostgreSQL database on Railway
2. Run Prisma migrations
3. Seed initial admin user
4. Test database connectivity
```

### **Phase 2: Backend Deployment (Priority 2)**

#### Step 1: Deploy Backend Successfully
```bash
# Goals:
- Backend API responding on Railway URL
- Health check endpoint working (/health)
- Database connections established
- Authentication endpoints functional
```

#### Step 2: API Testing
```bash
# Test endpoints:
- GET /health (system status)
- POST /api/auth/login (authentication)
- GET /api/articles (content retrieval)
- POST /api/articles (content creation)
```

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Priority 3)**

#### Step 1: Update API Configuration
```typescript
// Update API base URL in frontend to point to Railway backend
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'https://your-railway-backend.railway.app'
```

#### Step 2: Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend environment variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
```
