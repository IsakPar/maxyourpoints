# Max Your Points CMS - Development Build Logs

*Daily development journal tracking progress from concept to production*

---

## April 2025

### April 3, 2025
Starting fresh with Next.js 15.2.4. Set up the basic project structure today. Went with pnpm since it's faster than npm. 

Initial setup:
- Next.js with App Router
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui 
- TypeScript configuration
- Basic folder structure

Tomorrow: Database schema design

### April 4, 2025
Spent most of the day on database design. PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM seems like the right choice. Created initial schema for:
- Users (with roles)
- Articles 
- Categories/Subcategories
- Media

Had some issues with the Prisma setup but got it working eventually. The relationship between articles and categories took longer than expected.

### April 7, 2025 
Weekend break helped clear my head. Back to coding today.

Started working on authentication system. Using Supabase for now but might migrate later. Got basic login/logout working but the admin dashboard is still just a placeholder.

Note: Need to implement proper role-based access control

### April 8, 2025
Authentication is getting complicated. Spent 4 hours trying to get the middleware working properly. Keep getting redirect loops üò§

Finally figured it out - was checking auth state in the wrong place. The admin routes are now properly protected.

Created basic admin layout with navigation. Nothing fancy yet but functional.

### April 9, 2025
Started on the rich text editor today. Trying to decide between TipTap and Lexical. TipTap seems more straightforward but Lexical has better performance.

Went with a custom solution using @tiptap/react. Got basic formatting working:
- Bold, italic, underline
- Headers (H1-H6)
- Lists (ordered/unordered)
- Links

Still need to add image support and better styling.

### April 10, 2025
Rich text editor is coming along nicely. Added image upload functionality but it's still buggy. Images sometimes don't render correctly.

Also started working on the article creation form. Using react-hook-form for validation. 

TODO: 
- Fix image upload bugs
- Add SEO fields to article form
- Create preview functionality

### April 11, 2025
BREAKTHROUGH DAY! üéâ

Got the image upload working properly. The issue was with the file handling on the backend. Now supporting:
- HEIC to PNG conversion (for iPhone photos)
- Automatic compression 
- Responsive image generation

Also implemented the basic article CRUD operations. Can create, read, update, and delete articles now.

### April 14, 2025
Back from weekend. Started implementing the SEO optimization tools. This is going to be a key differentiator for our CMS.

Built a real-time SEO analyzer that checks:
- Title length and keywords
- Meta description optimization
- Header structure (H1, H2, H3 hierarchy)
- Image alt text
- Content length

The scoring algorithm is pretty basic right now but gives useful feedback.

### April 15, 2025
SEO tools are getting more sophisticated. Added:
- Keyword density analysis
- Readability scoring (Flesch reading ease)
- Semantic HTML suggestions
- Open Graph meta tag generation

The real-time scoring is working well. Articles get a score out of 100 and suggestions for improvement.

Started working on the category system today too.

### April 16, 2025
Category system is done! Hierarchical structure working:
- Airlines & Aviation
  - Commercial Airlines
  - Business Class Reviews
  - Airport Lounges
- Credit Cards & Points
  - Credit Card Reviews
  - Points Transfer Partners
  - Award Booking Strategies
- Hotels & Trip Reports
  - Hotel Reviews
  - Trip Reports
  - Vacation Rentals
- Travel Hacks & Deals
  - Flight Deals
  - Hotel Promotions
  - Travel Tips

Dynamic routing for category pages is working. Each category has its own dedicated page with filtered articles.

### April 17, 2025
Had a frustrating day with the rich text editor. The content wasn't saving properly - kept losing formatting. Turns out it was a serialization issue with the Tiptap output.

Fixed it by changing how we store the content. Now saving both HTML and JSON versions for maximum compatibility.

Also added auto-save functionality. Articles save every 30 seconds automatically.

### April 18, 2025
Media management system today. Built a proper media library where users can:
- Upload multiple images at once
- Organize images in folders  
- Search and filter media
- View image metadata (size, dimensions, etc.)

The drag-and-drop upload is really smooth. Users are going to love this.

### April 21, 2025
Started the week with search functionality. Implemented full-text search across:
- Article titles
- Content body
- Categories
- Tags

Using PostgreSQL's built-in search capabilities for now. Might upgrade to Elasticsearch later if needed.

The search results page has nice filtering options and highlights matching terms.

### April 22, 2025
Performance optimization day. The app was getting slow with more content. 

Implemented:
- Image optimization with Sharp
- Content caching with Redis
- Database query optimization
- Lazy loading for components

Page load times improved from ~5 seconds to under 2 seconds. Much better!

### April 23, 2025
Working on the frontend blog display. Created beautiful article cards with:
- Featured images
- Category tags
- Reading time estimates
- SEO-optimized URLs

The homepage now shows featured articles and recent posts. Looking good!

### April 24, 2025

- Rich text editor sometimes crashes on long content ‚ùå FIXED
- Image uploads fail for files > 5MB ‚ùå FIXED

- Email capture form (using Mailgun)
- Unsubscribe handling
- Admin panel to manage subscribers
- Double opt-in confirmation

The signup form is integrated into the blog layout and looks clean.

### April 28, 2025
Started working on content migration tools. Need to import existing articles from the old system.

Built a CSV import tool that handles:
- Article metadata
- Content formatting
- Category assignment
- Author mapping

Tested with 50 sample articles - works perfectly!

### April 29, 2025
Advanced SEO features today:
- Automatic schema.org markup generation
- XML sitemap creation
- Meta tag optimization suggestions
- Social media preview generation

The semantic analyzer can now detect content types and suggest appropriate schema markup. Really proud of this feature.

üöÄ **CURRENT STATUS** üöÄ

Made huge progress migrating away from Supabase to our custom backend. Frontend is production-ready and deployable. Backend needs database connection but has graceful fallbacks.

**What's Working:**
‚úÖ Frontend builds successfully
‚úÖ All pages render correctly
‚úÖ Graceful error handling when backend is offline
‚úÖ Production-optimized code
‚úÖ SEO tools fully functional
‚úÖ Admin interface complete

**Current Issues:**
- Backend needs proper database connection (Railway setup in progress)
- Some webpack runtime errors in dev (working on fixing)

**Ready for Deployment:**
The frontend can be deployed immediately. It handles the disconnected backend gracefully and shows fallback content. Once we get the database connected, dynamic content will load properly.

**Next Steps:**
1. Finish Railway database setup
2. Connect backend to production DB
3. Deploy both frontend and backend
4. Go live! üéâ

This has been an incredible journey from April 3rd to today. Despite the backend pivot, we're in a great position to launch soon.
